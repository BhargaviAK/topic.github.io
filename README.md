Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## üõ† Projects

### **Smart waste management system** 

*OVERVIEW:*  

- **Smart Waste Segregation System:**
‚óè Description: A system that categorizes waste based on its type (organic, plastic, metal,
paper) and provides a structured report on the volume of waste collected over time.

- **Waste Disposal and Recycling Recommendation System:**
‚óè Description: A program that recommends appropriate disposal or recycling methods
based on the waste type and material.
- **Waste Volume Prediction System:**
‚óè Description: Predicts the future volume of waste generated in an area based on
historical data, helping in efficient resource allocation.
- **Smart Bin Monitoring System:**
‚óè Description: A system that monitors smart bins and alerts users when they are full,
providing real-time data analysis.
-  **E-Waste Management System:**
‚óè Description: Assists users in categorizing and recycling e-waste, employing Quadratic
Probing for efficient hash collision handling.
- **Waste-to-Energy Conversion System:**
‚óè Description: A module that identifies waste suitable for energy generation, such as
incineration or biogas production, monitors energy output from waste conversion plants,
and generates efficiency reports to optimize energy recovery.
-  **Citizen Complaint and Feedback System:**
‚óè Description: A system for citizens to report and track waste management issues,
prioritizing complaints by urgency using a Priority Queue.
-  **Smart Composting System:**
‚óè Description: Monitors and automates the composting process for organic waste
-  **Real-Time Waste Tracking System:**
‚óè Description: Tracks the real-time location and movement of waste collection vehicles.
-  **Hazardous Waste Management System:**
‚óè Description: Tracks and safely disposes of hazardous materials.
*Technical Stack:*  

- **Languages:** C++. 
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra‚Äôs, A*, KMP, Linear search,Merge sort,Quick sort,Binary search tree,Priority queue, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- **Tools:** Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

**Impact:** 

- Smart Waste Segregation System: Enhances recycling efficiency by categorizing waste accurately, reducing landfill burden, and supporting sustainable practices.
- Waste Disposal and Recycling Recommendation System: Promotes responsible disposal and recycling, reducing environmental pollution and maximizing material recovery.
- Waste Volume Prediction System: Enables better resource allocation and planning for waste management operations, minimizing overflows and inefficiencies.
- Smart Bin Monitoring System: Prevents waste overflow in bins, ensuring cleaner environments and optimizing collection schedules.
- E-Waste Management System: Simplifies e-waste recycling, reducing toxic waste accumulation and encouraging proper disposal of electronic items.
- Waste-to-Energy Conversion System: Converts waste into renewable energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and providing a sustainable energy source.
- Citizen Complaint and Feedback System: Empowers citizens to participate in waste management, improving service efficiency and responsiveness.
- Smart Composting System: Automates organic waste processing, producing high-quality compost while reducing methane emissions from landfills.
- Real-Time Waste Tracking System: Improves operational transparency, ensuring timely waste collection and reducing fuel consumption.
- Hazardous Waste Management System: Ensures safe handling and disposal of hazardous materials, protecting public health and the environment.
